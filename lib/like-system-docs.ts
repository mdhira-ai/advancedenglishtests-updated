// Enhanced Like System with Supabase Realtime
// This file demonstrates the enhanced like functionality implemented in useSpeakingRoom.ts

/*
FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Optimistic UI Updates**:
   - When a user clicks "Like", the UI updates immediately showing the new state
   - The like count increments/decrements instantly
   - If the database operation fails, the UI reverts to the previous state

2. **Real-time Synchronization**:
   - All participants in the room see like updates in real-time
   - Uses Supabase's postgres_changes subscription to listen for database changes
   - Handles both INSERT (new likes) and DELETE (unlikes) events

3. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Network failures are handled gracefully
   - UI state reverts on errors
   - Database consistency is maintained with fallback refreshes

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Parallel fetching of user like status and total counts
   - Immediate UI feedback with background database sync
   - Debounced consistency checks

USAGE IN COMPONENT:
```tsx
import { useSpeakingRoom } from '@/hooks/useSpeakingRoom'

export function SpeakingRoomComponent() {
  const { participantLikes, toggleParticipantLike } = useSpeakingRoom(roomCode)
  
  return (
    <Button
      onClick={() => toggleParticipantLike(participant.id)}
      disabled={participantLikes[participant.id]?.isLoading}
    >
      {participantLikes[participant.id]?.hasLiked ? 'Liked!' : 'Like'}
      ({participantLikes[participant.id]?.likesCount || 0})
    </Button>
  )
}
```

DATABASE SCHEMA REQUIREMENTS:
The speaking_room_likes table should have:
- id (primary key)
- room_id (foreign key to speaking_rooms.id)
- liker_id (foreign key to user.id) - the user giving the like
- liked_user_id (foreign key to user.id) - the user receiving the like
- created_at (timestamp)

REALTIME SUBSCRIPTION:
The system subscribes to all changes on the speaking_room_likes table:
- INSERT events: When someone gives a like
- DELETE events: When someone removes a like
- UPDATE events: (not used in current implementation)

The subscription immediately updates the UI state for all participants in the room,
ensuring everyone sees the like changes in real-time.
